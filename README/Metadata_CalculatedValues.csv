PercentBrownMin,factor,categorical,percent,n/a,minimum value of percent brown measurements of plant individuals
PercentBrownMax,factor,categorical,percent,n/a,maximum value of percent brown measurements of plant individuals
PercentBrown_Est,factor,categorical,percent,n/a,estimated percent brown of individuals which we stopped taking measurements on (after dead for 2 weeks). Estimates were based on last measurement. Intention is to retain sample size

WaterWeight_Base,numeric,numerical,grams,1,grams of water in soil when completely saturated. Calculated as WeightMax – WeightMin
WaterWeight_Calc,numeric,numerical,grams,1,grams of water in soil each week. Calculated as WeightMax – Weight_g (each week)
PercentWater,numeric,numerical,percent,0.1,percent water remaining in soil each week
Temperature_avg,numeric,numerical,degrees Celsius,0.1,calculated average temperature per chamber
PercentGreen,numeric,numerical,percent,0.01,calculated percent of green pixels in each photo (when green color value intensity exceeds red)
