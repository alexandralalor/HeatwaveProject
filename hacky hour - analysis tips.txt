bin colors into thresholds of green and brown?
PCA to make bins
 - pca you pre-define dimensions

Multi-factor analysis
 - don't have to pre-define dimensions

we know when a tree is dead - use these pictures to classify colors as "dead colors"
maybe take 1/2 of dead trees to find colors and use this to verify if the other half is dead

sub set as training data
tree alive = these colors
tree dead = those colors
give this to full data to classify the rest. which ones are dying vs dead?

start with very alive trees and very dead
filter out dead/dying



3 steps
- image segmentation to reduce color diversity
- figure out what type of classifcation I want 
- combined dataset with phase 1 data
- plots and analysis
